     <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p >Food is definitely part of our daily lives.Because we we live in a very busy and digital world, people take the importance of 
        food lightly. Think about it...when was the last time you really enjoyed a meal. We go to a restaurant or a food joint eating and looking 
        at our phones or mobile devices.</p>

     <p>Food has been know to bring people with sharp differences together. It is able to break cultural barriers and foster adventure in learning about 
        different cultures. Ot has also been the cradle where the love of a couple was born. Food has sparked for business ideas and also a medium 
        where people experience fun. Of course, when eating there are dire consequences when food is eaten with no self control, its benefits if eaten
        in the right manner promotes wellbeing of the man both physically and psycologically</p>
